## 🎯 **Remaining Documentation**

### **Files That May Need Review** (Not Critical)

1. **docs/README.md** - Generic intro, still accurate
2. **docs/testing-resources.md** - May need test count updates
3. **docs/skaffold-testing-integration.md** - May need post-deploy hook updates
4. **docs/18-mvp-completion-summary.md** - Historical, accurate for its time
5. **docs/19-next-phase-user-stories.md** - Historical planning doc

**Status:** These are less critical as they're either:
- Historical records (accurate for their time)
- Technical references (still valid)
- Generic introductions (still applicable)

---

## 📝 **Recommendations**

### **Immediate**
- ✅ **DONE** - Updated project-status.md
- ✅ **DONE** - Updated FRONTEND_TESTING_STATUS.md

### **Optional (Low Priority)**
- ⏭️ Update docs/testing-resources.md with final test counts
- ⏭️ Update docs/skaffold-testing-integration.md with post-deploy fixes
- ⏭️ Add note to historical docs indicating they're historical

### **Not Needed**
- ❌ Historical planning docs (01-09) - Keep as-is for reference
- ❌ Implementation summaries (18-23) - Accurate for their phases
- ❌ Technical docs - Still valid
